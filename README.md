# NeuroDrive 🧠🚀

**NeuroDrive** is an assistive system that enables individuals with quadriplegia to control devices like wheelchairs or smart systems using their brain signals. Powered by a non-invasive EEG sensor and microcontroller, it reads neural signals and translates them into real-time actionable commands.

## 🧩 Features

- EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
- Wireless control of assistive devices
- Signal processing with Arduino or Raspberry Pi
- Customizable command mapping for user needs
- Safe and non-invasive wearable design

---

## 🧠 Device Used

- **EEG Sensor**: Neurosky MindWave or OpenBCI

---

## 🧰 Components

- Neurosky MindWave / OpenBCI EEG headset  
- Arduino Nano / Raspberry Pi  
- HC-05 Bluetooth or Wi-Fi module  
- Vibration motor or motor driver for output control  
- Portable power bank  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, etc.

## 📲 How It Works

1. User wears EEG headset.
2. Brain signals are read and interpreted.
3. Processed signals are sent to control module.
4. Control signals drive external devices like wheelchairs or IoT systems.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Connect EEG headset and read brain signal data.
2. Use Arduino/Python to filter and interpret signals.
3. Train the system to detect specific thought patterns.
4. Connect wireless module and test with assistive device.
